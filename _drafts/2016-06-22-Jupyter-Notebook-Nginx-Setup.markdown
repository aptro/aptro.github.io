What is Jupyter?


As Mentioned in the official Page : The Jupyter Notebook is a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

Jupyter project had a long history of development, It started with the Ipython project which provides a rich set of tools for computing and visualization with Python at it's core. In the recent years the Ipython project broke into small components and the Kernal is the core of Jupyter.

Jupyter supports multiple programming languages.

I would suggest installing from continuum anaconda project. It provides a seemless package management and virtual env setup tools. You can find the instruction [here](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
