When I started programming in python, I used to came across arguments regrading the Gil implementation in CPython which restricts the power of multicore machines. After searching and reading a lot of articles about the GIL and it's implementation I found a great talk by David Beazley which provides a deep down dissection of GIL. You can watch the Video here.

You can find the slides from Beazley's Personal blog and much more about python and Gil.
