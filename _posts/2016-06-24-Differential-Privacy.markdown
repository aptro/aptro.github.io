This year in Google I/O and Apple WWDC a bunch of new stuffs introduced, If you watch both the tech giants representing their new platforms there is a common interest in the space of personalization(siri, Google Assistant), messaging(Imessage, Allo).
Both companies are betting high on in the area of Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence.

In WWDC Apple opened up it imessage, siri, news and other App platforms for developer. Even introduced Siri on MacOS. Google also introduced Google Assistance and Home a thing like Amazon Alexa.

For developing this kind of highly personalized, localized context of user, a lot of data points need to be collected and here comes the Privacy. When it comes to Privacy Google and Apple takes very different approach. 

And when privacy is concerned I am more inclined towards Apple. Craig Federighi during his keynote at WWDC spoke about Differential Privacy for getting SIRI more Intelligent and understanding more about how people ask and interact with the virtual Assistance.

**What is Differential Privacy**

As Simple as Collecting user data while maintaining anonymity of user's identity.
